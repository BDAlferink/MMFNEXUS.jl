This will become available soon.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Usage","page":"Home","title":"Usage","text":"For now, the NEXUS+ algorithm is the only routine available. This requries a density field with non-zero values everywhere. For optimal results, we suggest density field reconstructions using DTFE, or Phase-Space DTFE. On how to reconstruct a density field from a particle distribution is found on the respective pages. The density field should be normalized, i.e. fracrhorho_textmean = 1 + delta.\n\nGive the normalized density field (densityField), we identify the cosmic web environments as follows:\n\nusing MMFNEXUS\n\n# field and box parameters (example from the reconstruction of the illustris-3 box sampled at 256^3)\nN = 256 # number of gridpoints per dimension\nL = 75. # Box size in cMpc/h\ntotalMass = 4e8 * 455^3 # total mass contained in simulation box in Msun/h \n\n# NEXUS+ parameters\nminimumFilterScale = 0.5 # minimum smoothing scale in Mpc/h\nfilter_scales = 6 # maximum index n in min_scale*(√2)^n. Here it does n = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6\ndensity_contrast_node = 370.\nminimum_node_mass = 1e13 # Msun/h\nminimum_filament_volume = 5 # (MPC/h)^3\nminimum_wall_volume = 5 # (MPC/h)^3\n\nMMF_node, MMF_filament, MMF_wall, MMF_void = NEXUS_Plus(densityField, N, L, totalMass, filter_scales, density_contrast_node, minimum_node_mass, minimum_filament_volume, minimum_wall_volume; R0 = min_scale);\n\n\nThe resulting MMF_* outputs are BitArray's of size (N,N,N) where for each voxel, one of the morphological environments has the value 1 and all others are 0 to indicate to which environment it belongs.\n\nFor more details, theory, and a tutorial, please consult the Documentation.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Contributors","page":"Home","title":"Contributors","text":"This Julia implementation was written by:\n\nBram Alferink (alferink@astro.rug.nl)\n\nThe original NEXUS+ algorithm published as NEXUS: tracing the cosmic web connection (Marius Cautun , Rien van de Weygaert , Bernard J.
